            <p>
              ABLE KOALAâ€˜s focus is on the quality of life and well-being of those with disabilities and/or aging. Our main objective is to provide harmony and peace mentally, physically and spiritually.
            </p>
            <p>
              The purpose of our work is to understand the needs of each individual. To support with empathy and understanding while minimizing anxiety and discomfort.
            </p>
            <p>
              Changes cause apprehension, adapting to change is finding balance in times of turbulence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our challenge is to assist family/caregivers to understand how to face a disability or the processes of aging. With a focus on acceptance, new skills can enhance connections.
